# real-fsharp-analyzer.md

## Language

- Analyzer file: `src/ast/real-fsharp-analyzer.ts`
- Parser: `tree-sitter-fsharp` (patched grammar — see Grammar below; WASM in `wasm/tree-sitter-fsharp.wasm`; also mirrored to `~/.bb/wasm`)
- Language detection: extension `.fs` / `.fsi` → `language-detection.ts`
- Wired in: `engine.ts getAnalyzer` → `RealFsharpAnalyzer`

### Grammar (M12.08)

The vendored grammar (`grammars/tree-sitter-fsharp/`) carries two patches
over upstream tree-sitter-fsharp:

1. **`interface` probe discrimination in the external scanner**
   (`common/scanner.h`): upstream mis-dispatches the first `interface T`
   inside an implicit class body into a bogus `union_type_cases` node —
   losing an Implements relationship and inventing phantom enum members.
   The patched scanner classifies `interface` after `type X =` as either a
   same-line declaration (`interface end` / `interface inherit I0 end`) or
   an implementation (`interface I with ...`) using a pure token-type
   lookahead, and reserves the keyword in the grammar only where the
   scanner cannot discriminate. The `interface` keyword is NOT globally
   reserved (that GLR-state change regressed unrelated IL-inline `(# ... #)`
   patterns in prim-types.fs); the scanner probe alone is sufficient.
2. **First-element `interface` fix**: with the probe, every
   `interface_implementation` node in the implicit-body form is emitted
   correctly (corpus check: fsharp@22a8a5dc — 5,836 `.fs`/`.fsi` files,
   968 files with error nodes / 6,234 error nodes; the previous wired
   build hid ~1,000 more errors inside a single giant 1,900-line ERROR
   node — the current build surfaces small, recoverable errors instead).

## Symbol contract

| Field | Supported? | How extracted (AST node/field) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | ✅ | `namespace`/`named_module`/`module_defn` → identifier; `type_definition` → `type_name` (generics stripped: `Repository<'T>` → `Repository`); `function_or_value_defn`/`value_declaration` → identifier / `function_declaration_left`; `member_defn` → `method_or_prop_defn` → `property_or_ident` (second identifier: `_.Log` → `Log`, `this.Greeting` → `Greeting`); `member_signature` → identifier; `additional_constr_defn` → normalized to `constructor`; `active_pattern` → full pattern text `(\|Even\|Odd\|)`; `exception_definition` → identifier under `long_identifier` |
| kind | ✅ | namespace → Namespace, module → Module, record/class/anon-with-members → Class, anon-type-with-only-member-signatures → Interface, DU / union → Enum (cases → EnumMember), abstract+default member → single Method, computed member without arguments → Property, member with argument list → Method, module-level let with arguments → Function, `new()` → Constructor, exception → Class, active pattern → Function, measure/abbrev/delegate → Type |
| qualified/container name | ✅ | `id` = owner chain + name; `parent` = enclosing symbol name (namespace → module → type → member) |
| ownerName / ownerKind | ✅ | enclosing type/module/namespace; top-level types owned by namespace or module |
| range (start/end line + column) | ✅ | `startPosition`/`endPosition` (1-based lines, 0-based columns — same as C#/Java family) |
| parameters | ✅ | `method_or_prop_defn` argument lists (`paren_pattern` / `argument_patterns`) on Method kinds |
| genericParameters | ✅ | `type_definition` raw name `'T` occurrences |
| documentation/comments | ❌ (not extracted) | non-goal for M12.08 (matching the family fixture contract) |
| complexity metrics | ✅ | `complexity` = symbol count; `linesOfCode` |
| syntax errors | ✅ | ERROR/MISSING nodes pushed as warning `ParseError` (never silently dropped) |
| decorators/attributes | ✅ | `attribute` nodes; TypeProvider attributes → Class symbols |

## Relationship ontology

| Relationship type | Emitted? | How resolved | Confidence model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calls | ✅ | `app_expression`/`application_expression` → leaf callee name (`Map.tryFind` → `tryFind`, `store.Add` → `Add`, `first.Log` → `Log`, pipe `a \|> List.map` → `map`); source = **enclosing function/method/constructor** (never the module); single pass, deduped by identity in the harness | 0.8 |
| extends | ✅ | `class_inherits_decl` (`inherit Animal()`) → `Animal`; source = the type | 1.0 |
| implements | ✅ | `interface_implementation` (`interface ILogger with`) → `ILogger`; source = the type | 1.0 |
| instantiates | ✅ | constructor chaining `new() = Point(0, 0)` → `Point` (enclosing constructor body); source = `constructor` | 0.95 |
| overrides | ✅ | `override` keyword token (first child of `member_defn`) + `inherit` base → qualified `Owner.method -> Parent.method` (`Dog.Speak -> Animal.Speak`); base from the type's `class_inherits_decl` | 1.0 |
| uses | ❌ (not emitted) | F# member-access reads are covered at call level; the C# family emits no `uses` edges — the previous `_.X` / `this.X` phantom uses came from member *definition* headers (`property_or_ident`) and were pure noise | — |
| references | ✅ | `open_statement`/`open_decl` → full module path; source = enclosing namespace/module | 0.9 |
| contains | ✅ | owner → owned members via `ownerName` (namespace → module/type, module → type/function, type → member) | 1.0 |
| depends | ✅ | imports → References | 0.9 |

## Supported constructs

- Interface declarations with abstract member signatures (`type ILogger = abstract member Log: string -> unit`) → Interface + Method — `Services.fs`
- Interface **implementations** in implicit class bodies (`interface ILogger with member _.Log(...)`) → Implements relationship + Method on the class — the core grammar fix — `Services.fs`
- Records (`type Customer = { Id: int; Name: string }`) → Class + Properties; computed members without arguments (`member this.Greeting = ...`, `member _.X = x`) → Property, NOT Method — `Domain.fs`, `Features.fs`
- Discriminated unions (`type Shape = Circle \| Rectangle`) → Enum + EnumMember; members on a DU (`member this.Area = ...`) → Property — `Features.fs`
- Generic interface (`type Repository<'T>`) with abstract members — `Domain.fs`
- Abstract member + `default` implementation (`abstract member Speak: unit -> string` + `default _.Speak() = "..."`) → ONE Method (dedup: the abstract signature is the canonical symbol; the default impl is skipped) — `Features.fs`
- Inheritance + override (`inherit Animal()` + `override _.Speak() = "Woof"`) → extends + qualified overrides `Dog.Speak -> Animal.Speak` — `Features.fs`
- Additional constructor (`new() = Point(0, 0)`) → Constructor named `constructor` + instantiates — `Features.fs`
- `exception NotFound of string` → Class symbol (name extracted from the `long_identifier`) — `Features.fs`
- Active patterns (`let (|Even|Odd|) n = ...`) → ONE Function named `(\|Even\|Odd\|)` — `Features.fs`
- Module-level functions with curried arguments; calls attribute to the enclosing function — `Domain.fs`
- Computation expressions (`async { return format customer }`) → the inner call attributes to the enclosing function — `Domain.fs`
- Negative fixture (`Negative.fs`): locals (`let localA = 1` inside a body) are NOT symbols; lambda params are NOT symbols; function params are NOT symbols; `Console.WriteLine` and `s.ToString`/`t.Equals`/`t.GetHashCode`/`t.GetType` are filtered builtins; pipeline `items |> List.map (fun x -> x * 2)` DOES emit a call (`map`) — positive control.

## Unsupported / explicit-unknown constructs

- **Property getters emit no calls** (C# family contract: `Display => Name.ToUpper()` emits no calls in C# either). F# computed properties are extracted as symbols; their bodies are not call sources.
- **`abstract` + `default` dedup**: only the abstract member signature line is kept as the symbol. The default implementation line is walked for relationships but does not produce a second symbol. Documented.
- **`uses`/`field_access` edges**: not materialized — documented non-goal, consistent with the C# family contract (zero uses in the C# ground truth).
- **Interface implementation members in the walk**: `member _.Log(...)` under `interface ILogger with` is a Method on the implementing class (correct); the abstract signature on the interface is a separate Method symbol (correct — different owners).
- **Object expressions** (`{ new IFoo with ... }`): emitted as `new <iface>` Class + Implements; not covered by fixtures (documented).

## Regex inventory

The analyzer is **fully regex-free** — no `RegExp`, no `.match(`/`.replace(` with patterns. Kind classification (record → class, DU → enum, anon member-signatures → interface), override detection (`firstTokenIs(node, "override")` reads the tree-sitter token), and property-vs-method (argument-list presence in `method_or_prop_defn`) are all pure AST decisions. The only string operations are exact-set membership (`Set.has`) and `split(".")` for leaf names.

## Complexity envelope

From `validation/m12/results/fsharp-complexity.json`:

| Run | files | symbols | relationships | wall ms | symbols/s | relationships/s | peak RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fixtures | 4 | 52 | 64 | 764.9 | 68 | 84 | 266.3 MB |
| corpus_subset | 376 | 36,901 | 128,401 | 219,074.0 | 168 | 586 | 1,305.6 MB |

Declared budgets: fixtures < 2 s (met: 0.76 s); 376-file corpus dominated by
giant self-hosting compiler files (top sample files are 290–755 KB —
`CheckExpressions.fs` 696 KB parses in ~8 s, `IlxGen.fs` 546 KB, etc.),
so the wall budget for the F# compiler corpus is declared as "large-file
bound" rather than a fixed seconds target. The analyzer's own `analyze()`
pass is faster than the previous implementation (854 ms vs 1,247 ms on
`CheckExpressions.fs` with identical tree) — the corpus wall time is
dominated by tree-sitter parse + the shared engine pipeline on 700 KB files.

Hot-path audit: single-pass iterative traversal (explicit stack, no
recursion depth risk); per-type member dedup via `Set` lookups
(`abstractMemberNames`, `baseTypes` Map); call leaf extraction is O(1)
string split. No O(n²) or per-symbol O(n) scans.

## Differential ground truth

- Ground truth: `validation/m12/ground-truth/fsharp.json`
  (authority: `manual_audit`)
- Result: `validation/m12/results/fsharp-differential.json`
- Precision / recall / FP / FN / unknown rates:
  **1.000 / 1.000 / 0 / 0 / 0** — 115/115 facts across 4 fixtures (3
  positive + 1 negative), zero parse errors.

## Corpus validation

- Corpus target: `validation/m12/corpus-manifest.json` → `fsharp@22a8a5dc`
  (clean repo, 5,836 committed `.fs`/`.fsi` files)
- 400 tracked `*.fs` files (deterministic first-400 sorted; 376 unique
  basenames in the flat sample dir)
- Parse quality: 968/5,836 files with error nodes (16.6%), 6,234 total
  ERROR nodes, 0 crashes. Errors are small and recoverable (the previous
  grammar build swallowed ~1,000 more errors inside one giant ERROR node).
