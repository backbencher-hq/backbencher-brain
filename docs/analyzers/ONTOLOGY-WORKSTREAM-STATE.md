# Laptop-B supervision state

Aggregate branch: `analyzers/ontology-laptop-b`
Main checkout:   `$HOME/mcp/backbencher-brain`
Lane worktrees:  `$HOME/mcp/bb-lanes/<slug>`  (one per language, node_modules symlinked)
Corpus:          `$HOME/fixtures/repositories` (~6.1 GB, ~90 repos)
Shared contract: `docs/analyzers/ONTOLOGY-WORKSTREAM.md` (committed on the aggregate)

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/tmp/opencode/setup-lanes.sh` | creates the 23 per-language worktrees + branches |
| `/tmp/opencode/launch-agent.sh <slug> <TITLE> <analyzer-stem> <BRANCH> "<missing types>"` | launches one co-agent in its own worktree |
| `/tmp/opencode/status.sh` | status board: alive / log age / signal / commits per lane |
| `/tmp/opencode/reprompt.sh <slug> [model] [message]` | re-prompt an agent that stopped to ask, or whose run was cut |
| `/tmp/opencode/merge-lane.sh <BRANCH>` | review-gate then merge one lane into the aggregate |
| `/tmp/opencode/AGENT-TEMPLATE.md` | the task template agents are launched with |

## Model — read this before relaunching anything

The task spec names `openrouter/stealth/space-bunny-alpha`. That provider's
**daily free quota is exhausted**; every agent died on
`Error: Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day-stealth` within a 90-second
window on 2026-10-02 ~21:50. All agent work was preserved on disk, uncommitted,
because of the per-lane worktrees — which is the argument for the worktrees.

Use **`opencode/space-bunny-free`** instead. It is a different provider
(OpenCode Zen, not OpenRouter) and is not quota-blocked. Verified working
before the relaunch.

Free models on Zen, as alternates: `opencode/big-pickle`,
`opencode/longcat-2.5-preview-free`, `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free`,
`opencode/ling-3.1-flash-free`, `opencode/nemotron-3-ultra-free`.

Models that are NOT usable from this box, so do not spend time on them again:
`pollinations/*` (no credits on the account), `explabs/*` (organization balance
negative), `zenmux/moonshotai/kimi-k3-free` (model not valid),
`tokenrouter/*` (token has no access), `agentrouter/glm-5.2` (no channel),
`kimi/kimi-k3` (public API access forbidden), `nvidia/z-ai/glm-5.2` (server
error).

## Why per-lane worktrees

The first launch put all 7 agents in the main checkout. They immediately began
`git checkout analyzer/<LANG>` on a shared working tree and stomped each other —
`git branch --show-current` read `analyzer/ZIG` while the ZIG slot was one of
seven. That was a design error on the supervisor's part, not agent behaviour.
Fixed by giving every lane its own `git worktree`. Agents are now launched with
`--dir <their worktree>` and the template forbids checking out other branches.

## Queue — laptop B's 23 languages

Ordered heaviest-first. 7 slots, never more.

Slots 14–23 are expected to be mostly RULED. For those the deliverable is the
corpus measurement that makes the ruling defensible, not new edges.

## Corpus counts at handover

Measured after cloning. Nim had 0 files and GraphQL had 2; both were unusable.

| lang | files | lang | files |
|---|---|---|---|
| dart | 31397 | hcl | 557 |
| yaml | 11297 | scss | 492 |
| json | 10719 | css | 667 |
| markdown | 10412 | sql | 1025 |
| fsharp | 5476 | xml | 1292 |
| php | 4609 | toml | 1086 |
| nim | 3970 | graphql | 192 |
| zig | 3040 | clean | 164 |
| lua | 2421 | ps1 | 893 |
| julia | 975 | R | 739 |
| sh | 1444 | proto | 324 |
| make | 437 | | |

Added to the corpus for this programme: `nim`, `graphql-nim`, `graphql-java`,
`graphql-js-full`, `shopify-api-js`, `vega`, `yq`, `redis`, `sqlalchemy`,
`dbeaver`, `duckdb`, `dart-sdk`, `riverpod`, `flutter-packages`,
`nvim-lspconfig`, `rocks.nvim`, `kong`, `caddy`, `traefik`, `ggplot2`,
`usethis`, `PSScriptAnalyzer`, `apollo-server`, `redwood`, `wagtail`,
`hasura-engine`.

## Baseline measured before launch

`npx tsx script/m14/ontology-coverage-gate.ts bash` on the aggregate:

```
calls         EMITTED      40,172 edges
uses          EMITTED      58,969 edges
contains      EMITTED      27,156 edges
imports       EMITTED         534 edges
references    EMITTED         534 edges
exports       EMITTED       1,180 edges
extends       RULED-SOUND   grammar produced 164 node types, none expresses it
implements    RULED-SOUND   same ruling
overrides     EMITTED         121 edges
instantiates  RULED-SOUND   same ruling
emitted 7/10   ruled-sound 3   FALSIFIED 0   ruled-without-justification 0
```

Bash was the most advanced lane at handover. The gate also emitted
`[BB-HANG] parser stuck 120s` on `proxicall/functions/scripts/audit_money_domain.sh`
and `[BB-PARSE-ERR] ... memory access out of bounds` on the same file — a
parser-robustness finding outside any single lane, filed for the owner.

## Shared files the supervisor owns

Agents report a need; the supervisor makes the change.

- `script/m14/differential.ts`, `script/m14/mutate-analyzer.ts`, shared `script/m14/` machinery
- `validation/m14/differential-baseline.json`, `validation/m14/results/*.json`
- `validation/m60/ledger.json`, `validation/m60/results/rel-type-coverage*.json`
- `script/m14/ontology-coverage-gate.ts`, `script/m60/rel-type-coverage-gate.ts`
- `src/ast/types.ts`, `src/ast/engine.ts`
- `website/src/data/brain-languages.ts` — derived, regenerated, never hand-edited
- `package.json`

## Review checklist applied to every finished lane

Reject and re-run anything that is prose instead of evidence.

1. A number for every verdict, or the verdict is not accepted.
2. Read the diff: did it add an edge the language cannot express?
3. Do the fixtures actually assert the new behaviour (not just exist)?
4. Does the lane's ontology gate still report the same ruled/emitted shape?
5. Does the lane still pass mutation testing?
6. Are the measurements reproducible from a clean corpus?
7. Did it touch only files it owns? (`git diff --name-only` vs the owned set)
8. Does the commit message carry the measurement, not an adjective?
