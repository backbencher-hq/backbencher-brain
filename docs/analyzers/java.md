# Java Analyzer

## What it extracts
- **Symbols**: classes, interfaces, records, enums, annotation types, methods,
  constructors (incl. compact), fields, interface constants, record components,
  enum constants
- **Relationships**: extends, implements, instantiates, calls, uses (field access),
  contains, exports, overrides, permits, references (imports)
- **Payloads**: qualified_calls, complexity (per-symbol cyclomatic), javadoc comments,
  genericParameters, visibility, decorators/annotations, apiContractPath (Spring routes)

## Evidence tiers
Every relationship carries `metadata.evidenceClass`:
- `structural`: grammar-clause derived (extends, implements, contains, exports)
- `usage_contextual`: observed calls, field access
- `inferred`: pass-3 override guesses @0.5

## Known limitations
- Override confidence reason codes added but pass-2/pass-3 thresholds not empirically calibrated beyond patterns.ts consumer audit
- Same-name ambiguity resolution picks one candidate without overload/language preference

## Verification
- Fixtures: 20+ (`validation/m14/fixtures/java/`)
- Corpus: grails-core@HEAD differential 100% coverage / 0 fabrications
- Grammar audit: PASS (0 unknown node-type references)
- Mutation hardening: 3 java-specific mutants ALL CAUGHT
